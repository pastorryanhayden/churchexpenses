    <p>There is only one way to add entries to this reporting app, and that is by downloading a CSV file from your bank
        and importing it here.</p>
    <p>We do this to ensure accurate accounting. Entries can be <em>miscategorized</em> using this system, but
        <strong>they cannot be
            invented or deleted.</strong> </p>
    <p>To use the app, simply download recent transactions in CSV form from your bank, and upload them here. Then
        categorize them using the budget categories your church sets up.</p>
